Here is a list of all of the ingredients that you will need to create the perfect burger!

   - 1/2 LB of Ground Beef
   - Salt and Pepper
   - 1 egg yolk The egg yolk acts as a binding agent for your ingredients.
   - 1 Egg Bun Lettuce
   - Frozen Chili
   - 3-4 Strips Bacon
   - 1 Thickly Sliced onion
   - 1 Tomato Slice (Optional if you hate tomatoes)
   - Lettuce
   - 1 Cup Mayonnaise
   - 2 Tablespoons Sriracha (You can add more or less to taste.
You can even replace it with another condiment if you hate sriracha. Personally, I prefer tartar sauce!)
   - Now, the recipe requires a slice of cheddar cheese.
Personally, I hate sliced American cheese. It's disgusting! Instead, use sliced cheese that doesn't come wrapped in plastic like Havarti or Provolone.
   - Grapeseed Oil
   - Butter
```

1. The first thing that you will want to do is heat your grill pan at a medium high heat.
2. Next, grate your frozen chili for about one teaspoon and season your burger with it alongside salt and pepper and the egg yolk.
3. Form your patty and coat the pan with oil. The patty size depends on how much time you have.
It should be less than an inch in diameter if you are cooking under 10 mins.
4. Add your bacon and your onion (unless you prefer it raw) and season it with salt and pepper.
5. When your patty and bacon are cooked on one side, flip them. You only have to flip once. While it is cooking. Add your slice of cheese on the patty and let it melt on the burger.
6. Once the bacon and patty (and onion) are cooked, keep your pan hot and shmear your buns with some butter and toast them on the pan for 1-2 minutes. Remove the bacon and patty and drain the excess oil and fat from your pan
7. Mix your sauces together and assemble your burger. According to chef Ramsay, the perfect assembly of a burger is Bun, mayo, lettuce, (tomato), onions, burger, bacon, onions, mayo and topped by the bun.
8. Finally, the most important step is to ENJOY!
